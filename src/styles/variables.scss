// Media Queries in Sass 3.2
//
// These mixins make media queries a breeze with Sass.
// The media queries from mobile up until desktop all
// trigger at different points along the way
//
// And important point to remember is that and width
// over the portrait width is considered to be part of the
// landscape width. This allows us to capture widths of devices
// that might not fit the dimensions exactly. This means the break
// points are seamless.

$mq-mobile: 320px !default;
$mq-desktop: 768px !default;

// Both portrait and landscape
@mixin mobile {
	@media (max-width: $mq-desktop) {
		@content;
	}
}

// Everything larger than a landscape tablet but less than or equal to the desktop
@mixin desktop {
	@media only screen and (min-width: $mq-desktop) {
		@content;
	}
}
